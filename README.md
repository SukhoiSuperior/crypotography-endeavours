 Repo for anything I code which I believe is useful or is of a quality to share.
 You may take any of this code to reuse in any of your personal projects but if you are to upload your code to 
 github and it contains my code in some way shape or form, please credit SukhoiSuperior at the top of your code 
 or in the description of the file.
